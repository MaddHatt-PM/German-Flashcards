# German-Flashcards
Using this to learn German and Python since I don't like writing tons of flashcards and I'm new to Python.


## TODO List
- [x] Figure out how to handle multiple py files
- [ ] Change around names since I'm shoehorning in C# naming conventions...
- [x] GuessTheTranslation game
- [ ] WhichOne game
- [x] Move helper files and data objects to a utility file
    - [ ] Might need to split those again
- [ ] Keep track of last ~50 incorrect words and store into file as JSON
    - [ ] Loadable from different sessions
- [x] Implement categories as a vocabWords processor
    - [ ] Implement last ~50 incorrect words as a special category
- [x] Add number guesser
- [x] Add time guesser

## Bug Tracker
- [x] Current vocabSetup is too complicated and prone to bugs(who could've guessed)
- [ ] Does not play normally in the terminal... VSCode might be doing additional debugging stuff that helps?
